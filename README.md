# Heart-Stroke-prediction
# Stroke Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model to predict a target variable (presumably stroke occurrence or risk) based on the age of individuals. The dataset used for this project is assumed to be named `Stroke.csv`.

## Project Overview

The main steps involved in this project are:
1. Loading the dataset.
2. Preprocessing the data (handling missing values).
3. Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
4. Training a linear regression model.
5. Visualizing the results.
6. Evaluating the model.

## File Descriptions

- `Stroke.csv`: The dataset containing information about age and the target variable.
- `script.py`: The main Python script that performs all the steps mentioned above.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

# Stroke Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates a logistic regression model to predict the probability of a binary target variable (e.g., stroke occurrence) based on the age of individuals. The dataset used for this project is assumed to be named `Stroke.csv`.
